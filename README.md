Hello! I am Romina and I see that you have taken an interest in looking at my little "guinea pig"

You are more than welcome to clone this React app called Sushi.

<h2>Motivation:</h2>

At first this was for a developer retreat I was having for my workplace, Stukent. It turned out to be more than I expected as I want to be able to use this for my workshop so others can follow it as a little template on what to do for their hands-on practice.
