<h1>Greetings to Sushi!</h1>

Hello! I am Romina and I see that you have taken an interest in looking at my little "guinea pig"

You are more than welcome to clone this React app called Sushi.

<h2>Motivation:</h2>

At first this was for a developer retreat I was having for my workplace, Stukent. It turned out to be more than I expected as I want to be able to use this for my workshop so others can follow it as a little template on what to do for their hands-on practice.

<h2>Installation:</h2>

When you install or clone this React app, make sure you have node in your computer.

<pre> git clone https://github.com/rharley95/sushi.git </pre>

Then make sure you run:

<pre> npm i </pre>

<h2> This is after I talk about how to create your react app first... </h2>
...Because soon you are going to work on your own! Following this little template for any help you might need.

I will also give you these links to documentation if needed:

<h2>Have fun!</h2>
